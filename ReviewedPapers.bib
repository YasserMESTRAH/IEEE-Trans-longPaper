However they are not well investigated in non-Gaussian environments, for instance when the noise is impulsive. In this paper we discuss the use of clipping to mitigate the effect of impulsive noise modeled as an α-stable random variable. The slope in the linear section of the demapper and the threshold have a significant impact on the Belief Propagation decoder performance. We show that judicious choices of those parameters can result in an important performance improvement.},

We characterize the error performance of the link, in terms of average and outage probabilities. The proposed model is valid for any linear modulation scheme (e.g., M-ary phase shift keying or M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation), and captures all the essential physical parameters that affect network interference. Our work generalizes the conventional analysis of communication in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise and fast fading, allowing such results to account for the effect of network interference.

  abstract = {The recent increasing interest in ad hoc networks has motivated the study and development of interference models capable of capturing the intrinsic characteristics of this kind of network, such as the lack of a central coordination and the consequent distributed nature of some of the network functions (e.g., medium access control and routing protocols). As a consequence, a myriad of interference models for ad hoc networks can be found in the literature, that describe the effects of interference at different layers and with different levels of detail. Some of these models describe interference as a random process whose statistics depend mainly on physical layer parameters, and are better suited for the analysis of issues related to the physical layer. Other models focus on the effects of interference at higher layers, and are more appropriate when the analysis of network-related issues is of interest. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of interference models for wireless ad hoc networks, emphasizing their domains of application, illustrated with examples. The interference models are presented in this survey from the perspective of the radio capture phenomenon, resulting in a unified view of interference models, which may be helpful when selecting the appropriate model for a given purpose.},

  abstract = {Because communications systems are seldom significantly interfered with by classical white Gaussian noise, it is necessary to consider other, appropriate (and tractable) interference models, if realistic estimates of system performance are to be obtained for the general spectral-use environment. For this purpose, Middleton's recently developed canonical statistical-physical model of "impulsive" interference is applied to real-world communication channels. The principal features of this model are first summarized, including the statistical relations required for the solution of signal detection problems. [Excellent agreement of these model statistics with correspondingly measured statistics is also noted.] The model for narrow-band impulsive interference (Class A noise, a subset of the overall model) is next specifically applied to an important class of coherent signal detection problems. Algorithms for error probabilities in optimum detection are then obtained, along with performance bounds, for the same error probabilities. Since it is known that in order to gain significant improvement over current receivers, the number of (essentially) independent samples of the received interference waveform must be enlarged (i.e., large "processing gains"), the performance results here are given parametrically in the number of samples, or equivalently, in the time-bandwidth product. Performance of current suboptimum receivers is then obtained and compared to the optimum performance. It is shown that very substantial savings in signal power and/or spectrum space can usually be achieved by using the indicated optimal algorithms. Since physical realization of the completely optimum detection algorithms cannot, in general, be economically realized, the somewhat more conservative, corresponding locally optimum Bayes detection (LOBD) receivers are derived. In general, these LOBD structures require adaptive, highly non-linear filters, preceding the conventional correlation detector - lements characteristic of optimum receivers for Gaussian interference. Performance for these non-linear, optimum threshold systems is then determined, specifically in Part I for coherent reception.},

Much less is known about the consequences when the standard AWGN assumption is not fulfilled in realistic environments and, more importantly, the appropriate countermeasures. The paper investigates the robustness of turbo codes decoded by existing quadratic-type algorithms in heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian noise channels. It illustrates that impulsive noise constitutes a major impairment in turbo decoding by studying the a posteriori probabilities computed by the constituent decoders, in addition to a formal account in terms of error probability performance. It is found that the performance of turbo codes is extremely sensitive to the shape of the underlying noise density function, being considerably degraded when this function departs from Gaussianity into a heavy-tailed distribution. A robust variant of existing decoders for reliable decoding of turbo codes in heavy-tailed noise is proposed and studied. The robustness is achieved by the enforcement of a non-quadratic soft metric into the decoder for good estimation of the transition probabilities and reliable extraction of extrinsic information.},

One important reason for errors is the presence of close interferers generating pulse collision. However such events are rare and we propose an α-stable model compatible with this fact due to its heavy tailed distribution. We derive the analytical expression of the two significant parameters. They depend on the attenuation coefficient, the users' density, the pulse collision probability and the pulse shape. We finally propose receiver strategies (Cauchy receiver and p-norm) that outperforms the classical Gaussian receiver.},

Assuming a 1/rγ propagation power loss law, the probability distributions for the noise at the receiver are found to be the stable distributions. Results are given for the probability of symbol error and link capacity as a function of the distance between the transmitter and receiver for direct sequence and frequency hopping spread spectrum schemes.

The first receiver outperforms both the conventional matched filter ultra-wide bandwidth receiver and the soft-limiting ultra-wide bandwidth receiver when only multiple access interference is present in UWB channels. The second new receiver with adaptive limiting threshold outperforms the conventional matched filter ultra-wide bandwidth receiver, the soft-limiting ultra-wide bandwidth receiver, and the adaptive threshold soft limiting ultra-wide bandwidth receiver in all multiple access interference-plus-noise environments. In multipath channels, a new Rake receiver based on the p-order metric receiver is proposed for signal detection.

The codes are built from highly irregular bipartite graphs with carefully chosen degree patterns on both sides. Our theoretical analysis of the codes is based on the work of Richardson and Urbanke (see ibid., vol.47, no.2, p.599-618, 2000). Assuming that the underlying communication channel is symmetric, we prove that the probability densities at the message nodes of the graph possess a certain symmetry. Using this symmetry property we then show that, under the assumption of no cycles, the message densities always converge as the number of iterations tends to infinity. Furthermore, we prove a stability condition which implies an upper bound on the fraction of errors that a belief-propagation decoder can correct when applied to a code induced from a bipartite graph with a given degree distribution. Our codes are found by optimizing the degree structure of the underlying graphs. We develop several strategies to perform this optimization. We also present some simulation results for the codes found which show that the performance of the codes is very close to the asymptotic theoretical bounds},

It is assumed in the literature that the power of the additive noise is known and the expected value of the fading gain is used in a linear function of the channel output to find approximate LLRs. This approach, however, is not optimal in the sense of bit error rate performance. In this paper, we introduce a measure of accuracy for the approximate LLRs based on their probability density function and we show that this measure provides a very convenient tool for finding good approximate LLRs. Assuming that the power of the additive noise is known, and using the proposed measure, we find a linear LLR approximation whose performance is extremely close to that of the true LLR calculation on an uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel. These results are then extended to the case that the noise power is also unknown and a performance almost identical to the previous case is obtained.},

In doing so, we generalize some of the results that were proved before for the erasure channel. We will generalize the stability condition to the class of Raptor codes. This generalization gives a lower bound on the fraction of output nodes of degree 2 of a Raptor code if the error probability of the belief-propagation decoder converges to zero. Using information-theoretic arguments, we will show that if a sequence of output degree distributions is to achieve the capacity of the underlying channel, then the fraction of nodes of degree 2 in these degree distributions has to converge to a certain quantity depending on the channel. For the class of erasure channels this quantity is independent of the erasure probability of the channel, but for many other classes of BIMSCs, this fraction depends on the particular channel chosen. This result has implications on the "universality" of Raptor codes for classes other than the class of erasure channels, in a sense that will be made more precise in the paper. We will also investigate the performance of specific Raptor codes which are optimized using a more exact version of the Gaussian approximation technique.},

In this paper, we introduce array codes into the PLC environment and we study the channel's performance. In particular, generalized array codes (GAC), as well as row and column array codes (RAC) are applied. We examine their performance by obtaining three different code rates from each category. Therefore, the (8, 4, 4), (12, 7, 4) and (16, 11, 4) GAC codes as well as the (9, 4, 4), (12, 6, 4), and (15, 8, 4) RAC codes are used, meaning that we obtain code rates of (1/2), (7/12), (11/16), and (4/9), (6/12), (8/15) respectively. In addition, for reasons of completeness, convolutional codes are also being applied under the same channel conditions. Moreover, we suggest a hybrid coding technique, which combines the (8, 4, 4) GAC and the (15, 8, 4) RAC code in order to meet the requirements of the PLC time-varying channel and improve its performance. Concerning the system's design, we take into consideration Zimmermann's model for the PLC channel. We apply Middleton's model for the channel's background and impulsive noise, while we also introduce a novel way of estimating the system's impulsive noise. Finally, the well-known transmission technique of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing is used. The channel's performance is evaluated in terms of the bit-error rate for different Eb/N0 values via computer simulations.},

  abstract  = {The design of a simplified Viterbi decoder for signals in symmetric alpha-stable noise is considered. The conventional Viterbi decoder, which has a branch metric optimized for Gaussian noise, performs poorly in symmetric alpha-stable noise. Since the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) branch metric is impractically complex, simplified approaches are needed. A simple 1-norm nonlinearity has been used instead of the Euclidean distance in the Gaussian branch metric to improve the performance of the Viterbi decoder. It shows performance improvement for higher values of alpha; however, the performance degrades when alpha approaches 1. In this paper, we propose a simplified branch metric which depends on a piecewise linear approximation of the log likelihood ratio (LLR). The Viterbi decoder with the proposed branch metric gives near-optimal performance for different values of alpha at low complexity. The simulation results show that the performance improvement of the Viterbi decoder with the proposed branch metric is approximately 1.5-4 dB compared to the Viterbi decoder with the 1-norm nonlinearity for different values of alpha.},

defining the approximation and evaluate its performance
when used as the inputs of the belief propagation decoder.
Our proposal allows us not only to achieve performance
close to the optimal decoding but also to have a simple
implementation and to adapt to different environment,
impulsive or not, independently of the underlying statistical
noise model, without the need of a training sequence.},

  abstract  = {The performance of Low-Density Parity-Check codes over symmetric alpha-stable impulsive noise channels is considered in this paper. Due to the lack of closed-form expressions for the probability density functions of almost all the alpha-stable distributions, an efficient non-linear approximation method for channel log-likelihood ratio is presented to achieve high decoding performance covering the range of characteristic exponent from 1 to 2 and avoid the use of complicated numerical integrations. The simulations for both long and short codes show that the parameter selection of the proposed method is not sensitive to the noise level. Even fixed parameter setting for the proposed non-linear approximation can obtain a satisfying decoding performance.},

  abstract  = {A modified gradient descent bit-flipping (GDBF) algorithm is proposed for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the symmetric alpha-stable (SaS) impulsive noise channel. To simplify the log-likelihood rate (LLR) computational implement, this paper introduces a linear approximation of the LLR for the SaS impulsive noise. Combined with the linear approximation, the new algorithm introduces a penalty factor into the syndrome components of the inversion function. Simulation results show that the GDBF algorithm based on the penalty factor performs better than GDBF algorithm.},
